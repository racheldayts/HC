    <h3>Clean Heat in NYC(HC3)</h3>
    <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px"> New York has been making efforts to switch to clean energy for decades, to try to combat the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions they have. 
    The NYC Clean Heat Program is a push by the New York City government for its citizens to switch to using heat pumps. 
    Heat pumps are a lot better for the environment as they run on electricity instead of fossil fuels. 
    In order to cool, heat pumps extract heat from inside and push it outside. In order to heat, they extract heat from outside.
    Some heavy fuels that New York City is trying to stay away from are No.4 and No.6 Fuels.
    No.4 Fuel is a commerical heating oil that doesn't need pre-heating. No.6 fuel is a residential oil that is heavy and requires pre-heating.
    Both are very harmful to the environment.
    NYC is doing more to be more environmentaly friendly, such as creating the DEP Boiler Registration and Greener Greater Buildings plan.</p>
    <h3>NYC Emissions</h3>
    <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px"> New York City is the #1 contributer to greenhouse gas emisisons in the United States.
    2/3 of these greenhouse emissions come from our buildings due to the use of fossil fuels for cooking, heating, etc.
    Brooklyn contributes to these emissions, not only from buildings but also environmental factors. 
    When it comes to emissions from buildings, Brooklyn has the third highest emissions out of the five boroughs, with a CBE of 7.1, higher than the NYC average of 7. 
    There are other factors also contributing to emissions in Brooklyn, such as food and transportation. 
    Brooklyn remains the third and fourth highest in these categories as well, usually staying close to the NYC averages. 
    Brooklyn does not have above-average greenhouse gas emissions though, with a matching CBE of 11 for Total per Capita Emissions in NYC.
    NYC is trying to combat this and introduce more environmentally friendly legislation, such as Local Law 97, which sets limits to gas emissions in larger buildings, which are usually high contributers.</p>
    <h3>Data on Brooklyn and Flatbush</h3>
     <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px;"> Brooklyn's data on MMBTU seemed to match observations and research from easlier assignments.
     Brooklyn usually had the second or third lowest numbers when it comes to factors causing emissions, like MMBTU. MMBTU is the amount of energy in a fuel, usually natural gas. So the higher MMBTU, the more energy in the fuel.
     If there is a leak, this can go into the air and be harmful. Brooklyn did not have a high number compared to the rest of the boroughs, as seen by the first plot below.
     Flatbush uses both No.4 and No.6 Fuel, and although both are bad for the environment, No.4 is used at a higher proportion than No.6, which is slightly better as No.6 requires pre-heating. This data can be seen in the second plot below.
     The boilers in Flatbush are definitely a problem though. As seen by the pie chart below, most of the boilers are over fifteen years old, some being in the age range 36-40 years old.
     Boilers should be replaced every fifteen years, so having boilers over twenty years are a large concern as this increases the chance of leaks, contributing to emissions.</p>
