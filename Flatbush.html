    <h3>Clean Heat in NYC(HC3)</h3>
    <p style= "color: black; font-family: Comfortaa; font-size: 14px"> New York has been making efforts to switch to clean energy for decades, to try to combat the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions they have. 
    The NYC Clean Heat Program is a push by the New York City government for its citizens to switch to usuing heat pumps. 
    Heat pumps are a lot better for the environment as they run on electricity instead of fossil fuels. 
    In order to cool, heat pumps extract heat from inside and push it outside. In order to heat, they extract heat from outside.
    Some heavy fuels that New York City is trying to stay away from are No.4 and No.6 Fuels.
    No.4 Fuel is a commerical heating oil that doesn't need pre-heating. No.6 fuel is a residential oil that is heavy and requires pre-heating.
    Both are very harmful to the environment.
    NYC is doing more to be more environmentaly friendly, such as creating the DEP Boiler Registration and Greener Greater Buildings plan.</p>
