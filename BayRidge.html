    <h2>Demographics and Statistics</h2>
    
    <p style="color: black;">Bay Ridge is neighborhood located southwest of Brooklyn, bordering the Atlantic Ocean. Bay Ridge contains the zip codes: 11209 and 11220. It holds a population of 85,984 people with a predominant elderly population. 
    For demographics, as of 2022, the majority of the people living in Bay Ridge are white. Specifically: </p> 
    <ul>
      <li>54.4% being White</li> 
      <li>20.5% being Hispanic</li> 
      <li>13.6% being Asian</li>

      <li>2.0% being Indian</li> 
      <li>1.9% being some other race</li> 
      <li>and lastly less than 1% being Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>However, as of 2024, it seems that the Asian population surpassed the White population. Majority of the male residents living in the neighborhood are in their mid 30’s while the female residents are nearing the end of their 20’s. Most households are earning a median income of $200,000 and more. However the second largest amount of households are earning a median income of $100,000 to about $125,000. In general, Bay Ridge is filled with households that earn different brackets of income, with the lowest being less than $10,000 and the highest amount earned being $200,000 and more. </p>

    <h2>Clean Heat in NYC</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">In effort of making NYC more environmental conscious, the NYC Clean Heat program was created. The program addresses the usage of No.4 and No.6 fuels by pushing building owners to install heat pumps in replacement of boilers. No.4 and No.6 fuels are typically used in boilers with No.6 being worse because it requires preheating. In addition to the NYC Clean Heat program, the Department of Environmental Protection created a DEP Boiler Registration program which requires building owners to register their boiler in order to use it, this way they can monitor soot emissions which is a byproduct of these oil-burning boilers. As a result of monitoring soot emissions, improvements to the health of the residents are possible. Both of these are ways to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases. Lastly, there is the Greener Greater Buildings (GGB) Plan, where the focus is on making buildings energy efficient since it primarily contributes to 45% of the city's energy usage. By implementing specific energy laws, it hopes to cut down the city's greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>NYC Emissions</h2>
    <p style= "color: black;"> NYC is making a conscious effort to become more environmentally friendly. As seen in the Clean Heat Dataset, each borough has at least 40% of their buildings following the GGB plan. This means that NYC is close to having at least half of the buildings in every borough follow the set of energy efficiency laws. Additionally, when we look at the fuels used in NYC, it can be seen that generally, all the boroughs use No.4 fuel more. While No.4 fuel is not better compared to renewable energy alternatives, it is easily better than NO.6 fuel because it doesn't require preheating. With no need of preheating, the air pollution isn't as much.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Data on Brooklyn and Bay Ridge</h2>
    <p style= "color: black;">As reported in 2019, Brooklyn has the second lowest emissions in comparison to the other boroughs. When looking at the information in the Clean Heat Dataset, Brooklyn's data aligns with this report. In terms of primary fuel usuage, for both No.4 and No.6 fuel, Brooklyn is the second lowest in No.4 and No.6 fuels usage. In fact, less than 5% of the buildings in the borough uses it. This might be an indication that majority of Brooklyn uses heat pumps or alternative energy sources. When we look at the average MMBTU (high) for each borough, we again see that Brooklyn is the second lowest. MMBTU is the amount of energy in a fuel and Brooklyn's average MMBTU barely reaches 6000 which is low when comparing to the other boroughs. Therefore supporting the idea that Brooklyn's emissions are lower in comparison. </p>
      <p> Shifting the focus to Bay Ridge, it can be seen that the primary fuel used in the neighborhood is No.4 fuel which again, isn't the best but in comparison to No.6 fuel, it is marginally better. Something to notice is that the counts for Bay Ridge is only 10 so any conclusions made by Bay Ridge cannot be used to generalize the entirety of the neighborhood. Looking at the boiler age range, it is shocking to see that majority of the boilers are between the ages of 31 to 35 years old. This can be concerning because the average lifespan for a boiler is 15 years and at most, it should be kept up to 20 years in its best condition. The fact that majority of the boilers surpass this can raise some concerns because older boilers are said to be less energy efficient and more prone to leakage. However, thinking back to Bay Ridge's elderly population, it makes sense that these boilers are old. There is a possibility that there was no effort to communicate these concerns to the elderlies. </p>
