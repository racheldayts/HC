    <h2>Clean Heat in NYC</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">In effort of making NYC more environmental conscious, the NYC Clean Heat program was created. The program addresses the usage of No.4 and No.6 fuels in attempt to reduce air pollution. In addition to that, the Department of Environmental Protection created a DEP Boiler Registration program which requires building owners to register their boiler in order to use it, this way they can monitor soot emissions which is a byproduct of these oil-burning boilers. As a result of monitoring soot emissions, improvements to the health of the residents are possible. </p>
