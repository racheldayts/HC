      <h2>Clean Heat in NYC (HC3)</h2>
    <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px"> New York City is one of the greatest contributors of pollution to the world. 
      As such, NYC’s government is trying to combat that. There are multiple programs in the works in order to make New York  City greener, including the NYC Clean Heat Program, the Department of Environmental Protection’s Boiler Registration program and PlaNYC. 
      The Clean Heat Program includes shifting reliance on gas to electricity for heating and cooling buildings by encouraging the use of heat pumps. 
      The Boiler Registration will allow fuel-burning boilers to be regulated and monitored which will hopefully result in less harm to the environment. 
      Lastly, the PlaNYC initiative includes the Greener Greater Buildings plan, which establishes energy efficiency standards NYC buildings must comply with. 
      Skyscrapers account for 45% of New York City’s energy use, so this plan was made to combat wasteful energy usage in these buildings. 
      Clearly, New York City is inching toward a more environmentally friendly future with these steps. </p>

    <h2>Brooklyn vs NYC Emissions (HC4)</h2>
    <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px"> Brooklyn is about average in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions it contributes to New York City’s high total. 
    Mainly, multiple fossil fuel power plants in the area, housing, and food are the main factors responsible for Brooklyn’s emissions. 
    Notably, Brooklyn is below average on emissions concerning transportation as compared to the other boroughs. 
    In attempts to lower emissions, NYC passed local law 97 which targets large buildings and requires them to limit their gas emissions. 
    Green House Preserving Program is yet another venture aimed at lower emissions, this time focusing on smaller buildings, loaning them money to use toward more environmentally friendly equipment. </p>
