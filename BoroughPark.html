      <h2>Clean Heat in NYC (HC3)</h2>
    <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px"> New York City is one of the greatest contributors of pollution to the world. 
      As such, NYC’s government is trying to combat that. There are multiple programs in the works in order to make New York  City greener, including the NYC Clean Heat Program, the Department of Environmental Protection’s Boiler Registration program and PlaNYC. 
      The Clean Heat Program includes shifting reliance on gas to electricity for heating and cooling buildings by encouraging the use of heat pumps. 
      The Boiler Registration will allow fuel-burning boilers to be regulated and monitored which will hopefully result in less harm to the environment. 
      Lastly, the PlaNYC initiative includes the Greener Greater Buildings plan, which establishes energy efficiency standards NYC buildings must comply with. 
      Skyscrapers account for 45% of New York City’s energy use, so this plan was made to combat wasteful energy usage in these buildings. 
      Clearly, New York City is inching toward a more environmentally friendly future with these steps. </p>

    <h2>Brooklyn vs NYC Emissions (HC4)</h2>
    <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px"> Brooklyn is about average in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions it contributes to New York City’s high total. 
    Mainly, multiple fossil fuel power plants in the area, housing, and food are the main factors responsible for Brooklyn’s emissions. 
    Notably, Brooklyn is below average on emissions concerning transportation as compared to the other boroughs. 
    In attempts to lower emissions, NYC passed local law 97 which targets large buildings and requires them to limit their gas emissions. 
    Green House Preserving Program is yet another venture aimed at lower emissions, this time focusing on smaller buildings, loaning them money to use toward more environmentally friendly equipment. </p>

    <h2>Data on Borough Park </h2>
       <img src = "folder/BP_boileragerange.png" id = "boileragerange" alt = "Boiler Age Range in Borough Park" style="width:400px;height:370px;"> <br>
    <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px;"> A majority of boilers in Borough Park's dataset were over 20 years old which is <br> way past their prime and should be replaced.
       When boilers are still used after around 15 years, there is more of a chance that <br> dangerous air is leaked into the environment. </p>
    
    <img src = "folder/BP_boileryear.png" id = "boileryear" alt = "Boiler Year in Borough Park" style="width:400px;height:400px;"> <br> 
    <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px;"> The chart above shows the year the boilers in Borough Park were made. <br>
    Clearly, they are all extremely old which, as explained above, can result in <br> malfunctions detrimental to people and the environment. </p>

<img src = "folder/BP_greener.png" id = "greener" alt = "Greener Greater Buildings in Borough Park" style="width:400px;height:400px;"> <br> 
 <p style= "color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; font-size: 14px;"> Greener Greater Buildings have laws that they have to follow which reduces greenhouse <br> gas emissions.
    According to the data as shown above, Borough Park has a greater percentage of not Greener Greater Buildings
    than Greener Greater Buildings. </p>
    

<img src = "folder/BP_fuel.png" id = "fuel" alt = "Fuel Used in Borough Park" style="width:400px;height:400px;"> <br>
