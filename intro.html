    <h1>Welcome to our webpage!</h1>
    <p> We are a group of three Macaulay students (Rachel Dayts, Hailey Tokayer, Kate Chung) using the Clean Heat public dataset to analyze and create conclusions about the gas emissions in Brooklyn and the following neighborhoods: Bay Ridge, Borough Park, and Flatbush.  </p>
    <br>
    <p> From the information in the dataset and our own additional research, we discovered that, as reported in 2019, Brooklyn has the second lowest consumption-based emissions with only 11 total per capital emissions. As observed in the dataset, Brooklyn has the second lowest count of fuel No.4 and No.6 usage. These fuels are used to generate electricity and are also found in boilers. However, a byproduct of these fuels is soot which causes air pollution. Additionally when we observed the average amount of energy required for the boiler to heat water (the highest MMBTU capacity), we noticed that Brooklyn has the second lowest amount, barely reaching 6000 MMBTU. From this, it can be seen that on average Brooklyn does not require much energy/fuel to heat up water. While Brooklyn has potential to improve in the environmental department, the borough is doing a great job in comparison to the other boroughs.</p>
