    <h1>Welcome to our webpage!</h1>
    <p> We are a group of three Macaulay students (Rachel Dayts, Hailey Tokayer, Kate Chung) using the Clean Heat public dataset to analyze and create conclusions about the gas emissions in Brooklyn and the following neighborhoods: Bay Ridge, Borough Park, and Flatbush. <p>
      <h2> Information about New York City Green Initiatives</h2>
      <p>The Clean Heat program in a statewide program that pushes for the installation of heat pumps. These heat pumps are more sustainable in comparison to its fuel-dependent counterparts. To explain it simply, heat pumps are designed to remove or put in existing heat from the environment to either cool or warm the houses. This doesn't require heating of oil of any sort which also means that there is no byproduct being created. Alongside the Clean Heat program, the Department of Environmental Protection created the Boiler Registration Program which requires residential buildings to register their boiler in order to be able to use it. The goal of this program is to be able to monitor the boiler and make sure it is up to standards. In addition to this, boilers release soot as a byproduct which contributes to air pollution so by monitoring the boiler, they aim to also reduce these emissions.  </p>

    <h2>Demographics of the Neighborhoods</h2>    
    <p> Borough Park had parts of zip codes 11204, 11218, 11219, and 11230. The overall population is 191,368 residents. Flatbush had parts of zip codes 11226, 11210, and 11230. The overall population is 104,530 people. Bay Ridge had parts of zip codes 11209 and 11220. The overall population is 85,984 people.

    <h2>Analysis on Brooklyn and its neighborhoods</h2>
    <p> From the information in the dataset and our own additional research, we discovered that, as reported in 2019, Brooklyn has the second lowest consumption-based emissions with only 11 total per capital emissions. As observed in the dataset, Brooklyn has the second lowest count of fuel No.4 and No.6 usage. These fuels are used to generate electricity and are also found in boilers. However, a byproduct of these fuels is soot which causes air pollution. Additionally when we observed the average amount of energy required for the boiler to heat water (the highest MMBTU capacity), we noticed that Brooklyn has the second lowest amount, barely reaching 6000 MMBTU. From this, it can be seen that on average Brooklyn does not require much energy/fuel to heat up water. While Brooklyn has potential to improve in the environmental department, the borough is doing a great job in comparison to the other boroughs.</p>
