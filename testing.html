<!-- Hey guys! Use this page as a reference guide :D 
We'll be doing html inline coding which means styling is also through html-->
<html>
  <body>
<!-- h1 is a type of header. It goes all the way to h6 and decreases in size -->
    <h1>Testing Page! </h1> 

<!-- <p> is paragraph so you can write anything. 
    make sure to specify the color -->
    <p style="color: black;"> Testing Page</p>

<!-- This is to create an image. First upload your image in the folder and then follow this set up and then you can plug in number to resize it. 
    alt is so that if your image doesn't load, the viewer still has a description of the image-->
    <img src = "folder/brand.png" id = "logo" alt = "The Earth with a plant sticking out of it" width="100" height="50">
